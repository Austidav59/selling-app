As a software engineer, I am continually seeking opportunities to enhance my programming skills and explore new technologies. This project focuses on creating a mobile selling application using React Native. The goal of this project is to practice working with mobile app development, user authentication, and real-time data handling. The application is designed to allow users to buy and sell items easily, providing a platform for listing products, browsing available items, and engaging in transactions.
The app features user authentication, enabling users to create accounts and manage their profiles. Users can list items for sale by uploading images and providing descriptions, while potential buyers can browse through various categories and search for specific products. The application also includes a messaging system that allows buyers and sellers to communicate directly. This selling app aims to create a seamless experience for users looking to declutter their homes or find great deals on second-hand items.
